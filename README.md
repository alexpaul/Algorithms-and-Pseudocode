# Algorithms and Pseudocode

**Algorithms** are actions and steps or directions involved in solving a function of a program.

#### Search for a Photo from Pixabay 

1. Step 1 Write an API Client class 
2. Setp 2 Write a function within that class
3. Step 3 Add the following to the function's body
4. Step 4 Add the endpoint needed to query the Web API 
5. Step 5 Create a URL using the endpoint URL 
6. Step 6 Use the URLSesson class to make the network request 
7. Step 7 Check and handle any errors  
8. Step 8 Use JSONDecoder to parse the received Data to the Swift model e.g Photo 
9. Step 9 Return the Photo to the caller


**Pseudcode** is a non-code way of explaining in "English" your thought process in executing a giving algorithm. 

#### Write a function to find the largest value in an array 

<pre> 
Input: array of Int
Output: return an Int

guard to retrieve the first value of the array, make sure it's mutable and define it as largest 
for each element in the array of Ints 
check if the current number is greater than the largest variable
  if it is assign the current number to the largest variable
return largest
</pre>
